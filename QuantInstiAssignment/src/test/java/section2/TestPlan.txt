Test Plan

Introduction: It is a service that manages resources for users.

Scope: 
	In Scope: Testing three endpoints: 
	1. /start
	2. /run
	3. /stop
	
	Out of scope:
	1. Performance Testing
	2. Unit Testing
	
Test Schedule:
	1. Week 1: Test Design
	2. Week 2: Test Execution
	
Test Scenarios:

Pre-condition: Any given resource at a given point in time can be only one of these states: S0 (initial state), S1, S2, S3, S4 or S5 (final state)

User story 1: /start Endpoint

Scenario 1: To verify that /start endpoint accepts only userID as parameter.
Scenario 2: To verify that resource is created for user at /start enpoint with state S0.
Scenario 3: To verify if the resource is successful for user at S0, the state change is triggered to S1.
Scenario 4: To verify if the resource is unsuccessful for user at S0, the state change is triggered to S5.

User story 2: /run Endpoint

Scenario 1: To verify that /start endpoint accepts Resource and userID as parameter.
Scenario 2: To verify that resource belongs to the user and is in state S1.
Scenario 3: To verify if the resource is successful for user at S1, the state change is triggered to S2.
Scenario 4:	To verify if the resource is successful for user at S2, the state change is triggered to S3.
Scenario 5: To verify if the resource is unsuccessful for user at S1, the state change is triggered to S5.	


User story 2: /stop Endpoint

Scenario 1: To verify that /start endpoint accepts Resource and userID as parameter.
Scenario 2: To verify that resource belongs to the user and is in state S3.
Scenario 3: To verify if the resource is successful for user at S3, the state change is triggered to S4.
Scenario 4:	To verify if the resource is successful for user at S4, the state change is triggered to S5.
Scenario 5: To verify if the resource is unsuccessful for user at S3, the state change is triggered to S5.
